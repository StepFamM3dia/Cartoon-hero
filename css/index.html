		<h2> About Rage'N Renwal</h2>
		<p>Ever realize how you get angry at almost the littlest thing. "Oh, It's beauce I'm an Aries" Lol. Well here in Rage N Renewal, you not only get to experience the joy of breaking and smashing objects to release any anger you subconcously have inside your body but be able to join a meditation room afterwards to reflect and renew yourself into your highest and greatest version that might be only a reflection period away. Come by yourself or come with friends. Your rage is always welcome here.</p>

		<!-- Into The Rage -->
		<h2>Rage out to Renew yourself?</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Rage is only pent up emotion</li>
			<li>Don't Take it out on people</li>
			<li>Transmute it as it's being release</li>
		</ol>
		
		<!-- After the Rage into the Renewal Activity/Experience -->
		<h2>What's the Renewal part?</h2>
		<p>Once you you lossen up your body and get your heart rate going, after your Rage session, you have the oppurtunity to enter a reflection period in a room where you are able to sit down to do some breathwork, Perform a Burning Letter, or even be open to a reiki healing thru holy fire for purification, empowerment and healing.
